Introduction
  This software consists of a library to record the commands userspace drivers send
  to AMD GCN GPU's.

Requirements
 - a C++ 2011 capable compiler
 - CMake
 - a Tonga based GPU
 - a libdrm_amdgpu based driver to be traced
 - clrxdisasm on the path for automatically disassembling shaders
     see https://github.com/CLRX/CLRX-mirror

Building
  It uses a standard CMake based build process. I haven't look at installation
  yet, so that may or may not work.

Usage
 set these two environment variables:
   LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libamdgpu_intercept.so
   INTERCEPT_DIR=/path/to/existing/directory

   The IB's and shaders get dump in the latter directory.

How to modify for another card
 The clrxdisasm commandline needs to be changed in code to disassemble for the
 correct GPU architecture.

 Note that this software has not been tested on anything but a Tonga card, and
 will not work with any card/driver combination that does not use libdrm_amdgpu.

Limitations
 Currently it only traces command buffers submitted to the graphics ring. There
 are some assumptions that have been true in practice for all my tests, but are
 wrong in general.
